# NAO Robot

The non-verbal behavior used to indicate much about a personâ€™s personality, by its body postures, head movements, gestures and even speed of its motions. 

In this project, I tried to manipulate the head movements if NAO robot. When it walks, whatever object is near by it, it will look over that object by moving its head. The certain body postures indicates certain emotions. And along with these non-verbal cues, walking speed is also manipulated of NAO robot to find the peoples preference of walking speed of NAO. The fast-walking speed or slow walking speed are the parameters which are manipulated during the experiment. 

The main research question is will people like the fast walking robot showing no head movements and emotions over the slow walking robot showing head movements and emotions as nonverbal cues. By showing certain emotions like happiness, sadness, thinking when confused, will it change or affect the mood of the person playing with the robot or not. The head movements will lead to perceived intelligence or more competency of NAO robot or not.
